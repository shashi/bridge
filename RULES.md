Bridge - The Rules
==================

This is a version of the bridge card game we play at NITK. It's less cerebral but as much (if not more) fun than other variations.

4 players sit in a circle, teammates facing each other (2 in a team).

Bidding
-------
Here you take a guess on how many rounds of play you can win with the trump suit specified in your bet.

* The guy who was served the first card while distributing gets to bid first, then the chance moves in a clockwise direction to the others.
* A bid has two components: A number and a trump suit
    * The number decides how many rounds of play you bet you can win after the first 6.
    * The trump suit decides which suit of cards can be used as trump cards.
* You can pass your chance to bid
* When 3 players pass, the bidding ends and the last bidder is the winner of the bidding. The plays can begin now.

Dropping of Cards
-----------------
* The person who won the bet gets to start the game by dropping a card of his choice.
* The others drop a card each one after the other clockwise
* The first card dropped in each round of play is of the suit the others must play.
* In the case that a person doesn't have any card from the suit the current play is going with, he can drop a card from any other suit.
* After all 4 players drop a card each the team which played the highest card from the trump suit (in cases allowed) or the highest card in the suit set by the first card win the round (in that order of preference).
* A team wins the game if it fulfils its bid or if it doesn't let the opponent fulfil his (in the case where the team had lost the bidding).

Happy playing!
